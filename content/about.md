# About Us

“Hell is empty and all the devils are here.”
— The Tempest, William Shakespeare

All The Devils Shakespeare is a newly established Saint Augustine nonprofit dedicated to bringing classical, professional theater to the public in bold, engaging, and accessible ways. We believe these stories are timeless, filled with passion, wit, ambition, love, betrayal, redemption, and hope.

Our mission is simple: to create high-quality theatre that invites the entire community to gather, reflect, and be moved. We aim to honor that spirit by producing work that is both artistically rigorous and welcoming to audiences of all backgrounds and ages.

Theatre has the power to bridge divides, to spark conversation, and to remind us of our shared humanity. Its important that we remember these stories, and apply the lessons to our modern world.

Thank you for your support, your enthusiasm, and your trust. Every season, and every production, we are committed to offering at least one performance that is completely free and open to the public. Access to art should not depend on income or circumstance. By removing financial barriers, we ensure that students, families, lifelong learners, and first time theatre goers alike will have access to this art.

As we grow, we hope to expand our educational outreach, collaborate with local artists and organizations, and create opportunities for emerging performers and technicians to hone their craft. Stay tuned for workshops, talkbacks, community partnerships, and productions staged in both traditional and unexpected spaces throughout Saint Augustine.

If this mission resonates with you, we invite you to join us. Whether you are interested in volunteering, performing, sponsoring, partnering, hosting a performance, or simply attending a show, there is a place for you in this company.
