# About Us

"Hell is empty and all the devils are here" - The Tempest

All The Devils Shakespeare is a newly established Saint Augustine non - profit that aims to bring classic and Shakespearean works to the public.
It is our belief that these stories are timeless and poignant.

Thank you for your support, your excitement, and your trust. Every year, every production, we have resolved to have 1 show that is 100 % free and open to the public.

If this sounds like something that you could use in your community, or you want to get involved, please reach out!
